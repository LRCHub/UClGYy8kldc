Oo baby, you been on top
ah my mind lately
Late at night, I moshi moshi
is ya home safely?
Wonder if I’m movin’
too fast, If I’m hasty
You tha favorite gift
God gave me I gotta say
Baby, you been on top
ah my mind lately
Late at night, I moshi moshi
is ya home safely?
Wonder if I’m movin’
too fast, If I’m hasty
You tha favorite gift
God gave me I gotta say
West to the East, I had defeat,
I’m a mortal man
Immortality comin’ closer
than what I can, stand
Stand for you, stand with me,
Stanford University
She a genie in a bottle
goin’ full on throttle
wit no motto or role to model
No home to coddle,
just cuddle right up
next to me in insanity
Lately been mainly
surroundin’ all around of me
She a tactician a mathmatician
Again, tha pen can’t writ
within describe on
what’s inside of my mind
Or inside of her heart,
back to tha start
We been separated longer
than before we was apart
This ain’t no shopping cart
Fill tha basket with love
If you don’t acquit
I don’t admit
We don’t fit tha glove,
Pushin and pushin been pushin’
too much turn into a shove,
Rushin and fussin and fighting
lookin for enlightenment,
Dissin instead of discussin’
on what be tha discussion then
Comin’ from wisdom my mission
been one of illa intention
Standin’ at attention,
you might get mentioned
I don’t mention anything
that have you wincin, Winston
Pull tha car around front,
give you everything you want
That’s the way that
I was taught
Don’t worry bout
these other thots
They could go and
shoot they shot
But they steady missin’ tho’
Just make sure you peepin’
on tha Code
Hidden in tha scroll
Oo baby, you been on top
ah my mind lately
Late at night, I moshi moshi
is ya home safely?
Wonder if I’m movin’
too fast, If I’m hasty
You tha favorite gift
God gave me I gotta say
Baby, you been on top
ah my mind lately
Late at night, I moshi moshi
is ya home safely?
Wonder if I’m movin’
too fast, If I’m hasty
You tha favorite gift
God gave me I gotta say
Baby, you been on top
ah my mind lately
Late at night, I moshi moshi
is ya home safely?
Wonder if I’m movin’
too fast, If I’m hasty
You tha favorite gift
God gave me I gotta say
