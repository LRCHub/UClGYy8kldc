I'm so ready to get gone
I'm feelin' like a powerful girl
So come with me, let's go
Together we can take on the world

'Cause we're so (we're so) beyond (beyond)
Livin' like we're typical girls
So take my hand and join me (join me)
Singin' hey, hey, hey, okay!
The world is ours

Moshi moshi, hi, hello
Did you call to talk to me?
Hajime konnichiwa
I like you, and you like me
It's time to say hello to a new day
And have a cup of tea with my very best friend (uh oh)

Are you ready to get lost?
Let's climb up to the highest peaks
And climb higher above the clouds
You and I can do anything

'Cause we're so (we're so) far gone
