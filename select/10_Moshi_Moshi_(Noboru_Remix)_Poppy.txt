I'm so ready to get gone
I'm feelin' like a powerful girl
So come with me, let's go
Together we can take on the world

'Cause we're so (we're so) beyond (beyond)
Livin' like we're typical girls
So take my hand (take my hand) and join me (join me)
Singin' hey, hey, hey, okay!
The world is ours

Moshi moshi
Hi, hello
Did you call to talk to me?
Hajime konnichiwa
I like you, and you like me
It's time to say hello to a new day
And have a cup of tea with my very best friend
Whoa, oh, oh

Are you ready to get lost?
Let's climb up to the highest peaks
And climb higher above the clouds
You and I can do anything

'Cause we're so (we're so) far gone
Livin' like the typical girls (Ooh, ooh)
So take my hand and join me
Singin' hey, hey, hey, okay!
The world is ours

Moshi moshi
Hi, hello

Very best friend, my very best friend (my very best friend)
Very best friend, my very best friend
Very best friend, my very best friend

'Cause we're so (we're so) far gone

So take my hand and join me
Singin' hey, hey, hey, okay!
The world is ours
