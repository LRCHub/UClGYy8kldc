I think I'm crazy, baby,
Let you off the too easily.
If you were a telephone,
You'd still be off the hook.
This is my last leg,
Been awake for days,
In a minute, I'll die of starvation.
I'll come back a ghost, if I can haunt you,
And float around your room.
What do I do when you get close?
If I kissed your neck, would you slit my throat?
Are you thinking of me, when you're putting on your makeup,
Darling, dying your hair like you do.
Well you're wasting your time
If you're trying to impress me,
I waste all my time just thinking of you.
And I'm not imagining
How you give me the shivers,
Standing up to the waist in your river.
You're the sweetest boat builder
I think I've ever seen.
Dream in Japanese, Dream in Japanese,
I'm like bitch, I don't even know how to speak.
You're still pretty, I'm still choked up
It's probably just the same.
The more I hang around you,
The more hang ups I get.
Are you thinking of me, when you're putting on your makeup,
Darling, dying your hair like you do?
Well you're wasting your time if you're trying to impress me,
I waste all my time just thinking of you.
I know that you're an angel,
But you could never stay true.
Hey angel, think you're halo's got a screw loose,
'Cause you dropped me like a brick
Off the rooftop of your high school.
Can I watch the next time you're applying your eyeliner?
I waste all my time just thinking of you.
